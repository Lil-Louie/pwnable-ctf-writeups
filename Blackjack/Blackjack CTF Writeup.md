## 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis  

The program allows the user to input **any integer** for the bet — including **negative values**. The vulnerability lies in how losses are handled:

### 🧨 Vulnerable Snippet:
```c
int betting() {
    printf("\n\nEnter Bet: $");
    scanf("%d", &bet);
 
    if (bet > cash) {
        printf("\nYou cannot bet more money than you have.");
        printf("\nEnter Bet: ");
        scanf("%d", &bet);
        return bet;
    }
    else return bet;
}
